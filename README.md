#### 👋 Hello everyone and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a Full Stack JavaScript Developer specialized in React, with a rich and unconventional background. From 2005 to 2022, I thrived as a Restaurant Manager, where I developed high-level skills in project management, team leadership, and operational efficiency, qualities that now serve me daily in agile tech environments.

In 2023, I transitioned into tech full-time, driven by a passion for building user-focused digital experiences. Since then, I’ve been working independently on real-world projects and client contracts, blending technical expertise, business logic, and automation to craft innovative solutions.
